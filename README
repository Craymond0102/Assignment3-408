Assignment 3

The assignment called for the data generator and the data exporter to work together.
However, I had a far larger need for my project, so I decided to make them seperate.
dataGenerator.py will generate Orders to fill my Order table. bloomberg.py will clean
tick data that I have collected and put it into our market_tick & ohlc tables in the 
database
